# Skork
Skork is a custom compiler for a custom script like language for a sort of game.
This description represents a prototype that is likely to be very different with 
each commit. The reason for that is because I understand what the interface will
look like but all the of intricate functionalities aren't completely thought out.

This project is meant for the public coding community to browse and look at
current Skork code. Feel free to fork it and make any update/addition maybe
a deletion you want. *But remember to do all such activities **in accordance
